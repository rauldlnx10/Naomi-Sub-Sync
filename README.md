## 📖 Project Description

Welcome to Advanced SubSync!
Advanced SubSync is a modern, open-source web tool designed to simplify the process of synchronizing subtitles with videos. Through an intuitive user interface, it allows users to upload a video and a subtitle file to visually and precisely adjust the timings.
Forget about manually editing text files. With SubSync, you can see the audio waveform, drag and drop subtitles, and make fine adjustments with keyboard shortcuts for an incredibly fast and efficient workflow.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Intuitive Interface:** A visual timeline that displays subtitles and the audio waveform.
* **Precise Adjustment:** Move and resize subtitles directly on the timeline with your mouse.
* **Multiple Formats:** Support for common subtitle files such as `.srt` and `.vtt`.
* **Integrated Translation:** Quickly translate subtitles thanks to integration with the [MyMemory API](https://mymemory.translated.net/).
* **Offline Mode:** Works entirely in your browser, with no internet connection required (once the page has loaded).

2. **Load Subtitles:** Click the "Load Subtitles" button to upload your `.srt` or similar file.
3. **Synchronize:** Use the timeline to drag the subtitle blocks to the correct position. You can also click on them and use keyboard shortcuts for finer adjustments.
4. **Save:** Once you are satisfied with the results, click the "Save Subtitles" button to download the synchronized subtitle file.
