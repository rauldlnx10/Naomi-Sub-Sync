# Advanced SubSync

## üìñ Project Description

Welcome to Advanced SubSync!

Advanced SubSync is a modern, open-source web tool designed to simplify the process of synchronizing subtitles with videos. Through an intuitive user interface, it allows users to upload a video and a subtitle file to visually and precisely adjust the timings.

Forget about manually editing text files. With SubSync, you can see the audio waveform, drag and drop subtitles, and make fine adjustments with keyboard shortcuts for an incredibly fast and efficient workflow.

## üåü Key Features

* **Intuitive Interface:** A visual timeline that displays subtitles and the audio waveform.

* **Precise Adjustment:** Move and resize subtitles directly on the timeline with your mouse.

* **Keyboard Shortcuts:** A complete set of shortcuts for tasks like moving subtitles, advancing or rewinding the video, and more.

* **Multiple Formats:** Support for common subtitle files such as `.srt`, `.vtt`, and `.ass`.

* **Customizable Themes:** Switch between the dark (default) and light themes to adapt the interface to your preference.

* **Integrated Translation:** Quickly translate subtitles thanks to integration with the MyMemory API.

* **Autosave:** Don't worry about losing your work. The application automatically saves the state in your browser.

* **Offline Mode:** Works entirely in your browser, with no internet connection required (once the page has loaded).
